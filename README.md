An OO/Functional Crit-bit tree in Java, inspired by
[djb](http://cr.yp.to/critbit.html), [Adam Langley](https://github.com/agl/critbit), and [Okasaki](http://www.eecs.usma.edu/webs/people/okasaki/pubs.html).

A primary goal for the project is to be more space-efficient than other Java
Patricia/Radix/Crit-bit implementations.
